# Crop Image

This code snippet rotates an image and find the largest possible crop window within the rotated image. It is a conversion of the Python answer at Stack Overflow question: [Rotate image and crop out black borders](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16702966/rotate-image-and-crop-out-black-borders) and JavaScript version: [Calculate largest rectangle in a rotated rectangle](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5789239/calculate-largest-rectangle-in-a-rotated-rectangle).

# ELA

This code snippet performs an Error Level Analysis in the image provided using the same technique as the  [FotoForensics](fotoforensics.com) website. ELA allows to see visually the changes made in a JPG image based in it's compression error analysis.
